<br />
On the RES12 V1.0 board, R10 and R11 had their values
swapped. The 15K is on the opamp output, and runs across
the board just above the 100R trimmer, the 2K0 runs along
the edge of the board. This has been corrected on V1.1.
<br /><br />
R17 (fourth down from the LM324) is marked "N/F", but must
be 330R. This applies to both V1.0 and V1.1 boards.
<br /><br />
There is a standard mod, fitting a resistor between
pad R (AGC input) and U2 (TL082/LF353) pin 2. 1M0 is
the normal value, although early Serges used 4M7.

Are the submodule boards made exactly as
silkscreen indicates?

<br />
<br />
Dunno yet. I've just started looking at the old sub-modules
in detail. Remember though that C1, the 47p across pins 5 &amp; 6
of the sub-module should be a high quality stable device
because they're across the 220pF filter caps. There's no
point in having a 1% 220pF polystyrene cap and putting a
scabby ceramic in parallel. Rex uses micas, which seems
like a good plan.
