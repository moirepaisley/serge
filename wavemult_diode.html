<br />
Hi all,<br />
Sorry, I can't find a final advise about what kind of diode to use in the "GE" position of the 
RES18 wave multipliers pcb.<br />
I searched the group messages but I only found the general discusion but not a final 
indication of what to use. It looks like a Zener, but wich voltage and wattage?
<br />
I'd like to include the correct info on the new 113_wave entry.
<br /><br />
Thank you,
<br /><br />
Fernando

A reverse biased transistor is frequently used in this position, 
so that would put the drop at around 4 to 5 volts, so a 4.7V or 5.1V 400mw zener would do the job.

I've not seen any value given for the zener, but some versions used a reversed BE 
junction of an EN5179 transistor. Serge used the same tranny in the 106B NTO VCO, 
and on the example I examined it gave 6V.
