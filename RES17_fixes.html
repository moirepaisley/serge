<br />
Alright folks,I got it working tonight!<br />
I went through the trigger section on the
PCB with a fine toothed comb and found that there were two issues:
<br /><br />
1) there's a .1 uF cap between the trigger input and V+, right between the 33 K resistor and the two diodes. Dunno why that's there, but I took it out. It's not on Dean's nor Driscoll's schematic.
<br /><br />
2) The 5.6V zener diode is connected between the end pulse output and pin 8 of the LM3900. I suspect that Ken's intention was to hook it to pin 7, i.e. ground.
<br /><br />
Once I corrected both of those bugs, the module oscillated quite well. VC control over the slopes is excellent for waveshaping. I totally understand why Mr. Driscoll added separate CV inputs for up slope and down slope.
<br /><br />
The only thing that isn't working yet is the LED, but that's really minor.I posted a JPG (res17_errata.jpg) to the files area showing where the components are that need to be moved.<br />
<br />

I reverse engineered the DUSG too, but the differences<br />
between Dean's version and mine were so trivial I haven't<br />
bothered distributing it, so if you worked from Dean's<br />
I'd expect it to work.
<br /><br />
Note that the LED driver is a<br />
separate assembly in real Serges, not part of the main<br />
circuit board, so I can offer no suggestion as to why<br />
that doesn't work... The LED being a separate module wasn't<br /> 
discovered to after the board was done. <br /><br />
As for the errors, there are two per DUSG on the board,<br /> 
exactly as Romeo pointed out. <br />
A bypass capacitor connected to a wrong trace, and the<br />
earth end of a Zener going to the wrong pin.<br />
