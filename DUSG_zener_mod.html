Another thing I noticed, three of my slope generators have had the<br /> 
exact same fault. They wouldn't cycle because the zener at the END OUT<br /> 
was damaged. Replacing it fixed the problem.<br /> 
</span><br />
It's pretty poor desig having the zener exposed to the outside world like that.<br />
In my latest DUSG I replaced the 3k3 with a 2k2 and 1k in series and put the
<br /> zener at the junction.
