More constructively, I built a 101A VCA stage during<br />
by lunch break at work today.  If there's time next <br />
week, I'll measure it's performance and report back.<br />
I have a Quad Pan board (not mine) to test too.<br />
</span>
<br />
I got my 101A VCA running today.  I used very roughly matched BC549s and BC559s, and a TL072 because I didn'thave an LF353.  
It was built on veroboard and measured in a partially screened environment, so a real one 
in an enclosure should be quieter.
<br /><br />
Gain:<br />
Pot fully up (0v), no CV applied - gain 0.35dB (i.e. unity)<br />
Pot at "12 O-clock", (-6v) no CV applied - gain -73dB (i.e. fully attenuated)<br />
Pot below "12 O-clock", no CV applied - no further reduction.<br />
<br />
Main CV input: +20dB/volt<br />
<br />
AM CV input: +8dB/volt <br />
<br />
Noise:<br />
unity gain: -67dBu (unwtd)<br />
minimum gain: -87dBu (unwtd)
<br /><br />
Distortion<br />
Less than 0.2%<br />
Output clips hard at around +20dBu.<br />
<br />
I think that's quite respectable in the circumstances.
I was surprised by the +20dB/v, as the later ones quote +12dB/volt in the catalogue.
I also noted that this held true over a wide range - no obvious sign of the range being 
restricted at the top like Serge quotes in the later catalogues.<br />
<br />
I've been having a long think about how equal power panning was carried out in the 100 series boards, 
but I still need to play with the quad pan board and maybe lash up a stereo panner to see if I've got it right.<br /> 
<br />
Is anyone finding this interesting?  Does anyone else have any thoughts on how Serge worked his 
equal powermagic? I think I understand it, but I'd like to hear someone else "piss on my bonfire".<br />
<br />
<br />
Cheers<br />
Steve
