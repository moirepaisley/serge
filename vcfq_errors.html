It's all gone a bit quiet. The great benefactor has provided<br />
us with a multitude of boards, and as yet, I've not seen a<br />
single "yippee, it works" (or not) message. So, any workers<br />
yet? Or any Voltage Controlled Smoke Generators?<br />

<br />
Well... the sequencer, processor and programmers all work for sure :)

Pin 5 is out of wack on the VCFQ for the sub modules.

I noticed that the 2N4248s I got<br />
go the opposite way around to that shown on the silk<br />
screening, but maybe all 2N4248s are not the same.<br />
</span>
<br />
The silk screen is correct for 2N4248, but backwards for PN4248.<br /> 
The 2N424 8was in a little epoxy domed 70's style transistor.
